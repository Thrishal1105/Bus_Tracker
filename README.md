# Bus Tracker

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

## Description

We set out to solve a real problem at our college, and that led us to build our own "Real-Time Bus Tracking System" from scratch.

As students of my college, we realized there was no existing bus tracking system in place. Every day, students faced uncertainty about bus timings, delays, or locations. So, instead of waiting for a solution, we decided to create one ourselves.

This project was developed as part of our 3rd-year Mini Project — a chance for us to take classroom concepts and turn them into something impactful and real.

We created a mobile app that allows students to:
->Track their college bus live on a map
->View estimated arrival times and current stop information
->Know if the bus is on time or delayed
->Access driver contact info and experience details

This is not a pre-built system or commercial product — we designed, developed, and implemented everything ourselves, using:
->An IoT GPS module (iMotive A7670E) to collect live bus data
->A custom cloud API to store and transfer data
->A Flutter-based mobile app with real-time UI for students

"The best part? It’s highly affordable and scalable, making it ideal not just for colleges, but also for schools, junior colleges, and coaching centers looking to implement a smart transport solution on a low budget."
