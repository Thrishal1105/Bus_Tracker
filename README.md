# 🚍 Real-Time Bus Tracking System

## 🔑 Key Highlights

* **Problem-Solving Project:** Built to address the real challenge of bus timing uncertainty faced by students daily.  
* **From Scratch Development:** Not a template or pre-built solution — designed, coded, and implemented entirely by us.  
* **Affordable & Scalable:** Tailored for colleges, schools, junior colleges, and coaching centers with budget-friendly deployment.  
* **Practical Impact:** Directly improves student experience by reducing waiting time and uncertainty.

## 📱 Features

* **Live Bus Tracking:** Real-time map view with continuous bus location updates.  
* **ETA & Stop Info:** Displays estimated arrival times and current stop details.  
* **Delay Alerts:** Sends instant notifications if the bus is running late.  
* **Driver Details:** Shows driver contact information and experience profile for transparency.  
* **User-Friendly UI:** Clean, responsive, and accessible design for seamless student use.
